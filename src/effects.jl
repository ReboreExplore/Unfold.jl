"""
effects(design::AbstractDict, model::UnfoldModel;typical=mean)

Calculates marginal effects for all term-combinations in `design`.

 Implementation based on Effects Package; likely could repackage in UnfoldEffects; somebody wants to do it? This would make it easier to cross-maintain it to changes/bugfixes in the Effects.jl Package
 `design` is a Dictionary containing those predictors (als keys) with levels (as values), that you want to evaluate. The `typical` refers to the value, that other predictors not in the Dictionary should take on.

 # Example
 ```julia-repl
 julia> f = @formula 0 ~ categoricalA + continuousA + continuousB
 julia> uf = fit(UnfoldModel,(Any=>(f,times)),data,events)
 julia> d = Dict(:categoricalA=>["levelA","levelB"],:continuousB=>[-2,0,2])
 julia> effects(d,uf)
```
 will result in 6 predicted values: A/-2, A/0, A/2, B/-2, B/0, B/2.
